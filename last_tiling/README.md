## Synopsis

### Rust

- encode.rs
Input: Alignment<LastTAB>, Contig<Fasta>, Read<Fasta>, output location1<Path>, and output location2<Path>.
Output: None(Some stderr messages)
Requirements: None
To encode reads into array of units by maf alignment.
Information on contigs would be written to output location1, while
the encoded reads written to output location2. They are JSON-encoded.
Example:
```bash
cargo run --release --bin encode -- [maf<MAF>] [contigs<Fasta>] [read<FASTA>] [output<PATH>] [output2<Path>]
```
To see more detail about the program, see documentation.

- convert_to_d3_data.rs
Input: a contig file<JSON> and a read file<JSON>
Output: Dataset for D3.js<JSON>
Requirements: Input files shoule be generated by `encode.rs`
Convert the dataset into lightweight representation to visualize.


### ./scripts

- run_cluster.sh
Input:None
Output:None
Requirement: All the variable in this script must be valid.
Run experiment on hx cluster.
